# Keboola Hubspot Writer  
  
The HubSpot CRM helps companies grow traffic, convert leads, get insights to close more deals, etc.  
Keboola Hubspot Writer will provide users the assistance to maintain and manage their contacts within Hubspot.  
  
## Requirement  
There are two ways to authorize for Hubspot API.

 1. **Hapikey** - Your Hubspot API key, This will be soon deprecated, see more ([here](https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/upcoming-api-key-sunset))  
 2. **Private App Token** - See how to create and assign permissions ([here](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps))
  
## Configuration  
  
First fill in Authorization configuration. Then click ADD ROW button and fill in the name by which you can easily identify the configuration row. Next fill in the Desired object you want to manipulate and then select the action you want to perform with this object. 
The writer will fetch all input tables and convert each row into the required request format based on the requirements of the endpoint. Each writer will write to `one` endpoint.

| Yes            | Contact         | Create           | A list of contact properties that you want to set for the new contact record. Each entry in the list must include the internal name of the property, and the value that you want to set for that property. Note: You must include at least one property for the new contact, or you will receive an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                   |
| No             | Contact         | Add to List      | It is required to have both `vids` and `emails` columns in the input data file. The code will prioritize the values input for `vids`. Example, if there are inputs for both `emails` and `vids` in the same row, the code will prioritize `vids` pushing this value into the request and ignore the value in `emails`. Please note that you cannot manually add contacts to dynamic lists. To determine whether a list is dynamic or static, when you get a list, you will see a flag called dynamic that equates to true or false. Up to 500 total contacts can be added in a single request. | `list_id, vids, emails`                                                           |
| Yes            | Contact         | Update           | This endpoint is used to update existing contacts, and it requires `vid` in the input data file. `vid` cannot be empty. The rest of the columns other than vid will be used as a request parameter to update the contact property. If either the property or the contact does not exist, the update request for that specific contact will fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `vid`                                                                             | 
| No             | Contact         | Update by Email  | Like the `Update Contact` endpoint, this endpoint is used to update existing contacts, and it requires `email` in the "inputdata" file. The rest of the columns will be used to update the contact's properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `email`                                                                           |

To determine whether a list is dynamic or static, when you get a list, you will see a flag called dynamic that equates to true or false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `list_id, vids`                                                                   |
